PROBLEM 024

Problem: http://projecteuler.net/problem=24

Solution Notes: I actually implemented two algorithms, one that ran in O(n*n!) which found all 
permutations and one that ran in O(n) which only found the specific one. The first algorithm 
ended up to be far too inefficient but should still be correct.
