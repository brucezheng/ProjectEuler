PROBLEM 018
-----------

Problem: http://projecteuler.net/problem=18

Solution notes: This implementation runs in time O(n) if n is the number of elements in the Triangle. A brute force method checking all possible routes would take O(2^h) time where h is the height of the tree. Since h = O(sqrt(n)), T(brute force) = O(2^sqrt(n)). Since Problem 067 is essentially the same problem, except forcing the usage of a smart algorithm, the code from 018 was reused for 067.
