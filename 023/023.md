PROBLEM 023
-----------

Problem: http://projecteuler.net/problem=23

Solution notes: divSum is reused from problem 021 (in addition, an error was present in the 
algorithm in 021, which was fixed). The total running time of the program should be O(a^2),
where a is the total number of abundant numbers in our span.
