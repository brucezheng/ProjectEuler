PROBLEM 025

Problem: http://projecteuler.net/problem=25

Solution Notes: Another brute force solution using BigInt. Possibly, I want to test the increase of
efficiency the algorithm would gain if I implemented BigInt wiht a vector, since my original 
reasons for implementing it using a list was based on faulty logic.
