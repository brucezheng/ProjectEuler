PROBLEM 013
-----------

Problem: Work out the first ten digits of the sum of one-hundred 50-digit numbers.

Solution Notes: BigInt was implemented completely by me, and is essentially a way of overcoming the size limits of ints. Each BigInt is essentially a string (list of ints) that can be added and subtracted, etc. Almost all integer operations are implemented in BigInt.
