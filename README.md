Project Euler Solutions

This is just a compilation of my solutions to Project Euler problems. Most of this code is original, but there
are exceptions and I will try to take note of them in the important folders. Project Euler is a website which
posts math/CS problems that are meant to be solved on a computer with runtimes of under a minute.
